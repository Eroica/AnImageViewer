= An Image Viewer

This is an image viewer.
You click on a file and it opens a window that shows that file.
Open another image file, and a new window opens.
Press the left or right arrow key to navigate to the next image.
You can quickly compare or browse images this way.

By default, the window size is as large as the image you open; however, never larger than half of your screen's width.
(I don't like application windows that extend/reach out over the desktop.)
If you then navigate to other images, the window size is kept the same.
If the window is smaller than the image, you can pan around by clicking and dragging over the image.

You can of course also let the image fit into the window size.

== A Little Bit of History

(Jump to <<Installation>> if you aren't interested.)

So one day I needed to browse a sequence of images (basically video frames) on my new Windows computer.
I double-click an image which opens the _Photos_ app and sure enough, I can look at my image, even though it sometimes asks me to look at content that it "`prepared.`"
Oh I needed to turn off notifications and other "`features`" in the settings as well.

Anyway, so I browse frame 1 of my images, then frame 2 ...
but for some reason, when I hold the Right arrow key to skim through each frame, the application always takes some time to load the next image.
Perhaps around 0.5 seconds or something like that, but this is on an Intel i7-9700!

"`That can't be right,`" I said to myself, and put together this image viewer.
There are of course probably better alternatives on Windows, but at least this image viewer works the way that I like, and I don't need to install additional things.

Most importantly, it opens an image, and if you press and hold the Left/Right arrow key, the next image loads immediately.

See here a quick comparison between _Photos_ and _An Image Viewer._
I open the same directory and press and hold the right arrow key (pay attention to the current filename in the title bar).

__To Photos defense, I later found out that it is largely some kind of intentional (?) input delay that takes place when you press and hold a key;
meaning that if you can hit the Arrow key rapidly, the application does manage to keep up with the speed.__

=== How does it work

If you open an image, An Image Viewer will automatically pre-load the next and previous images.
This speeds up browsing between images.
I'm sure there are better approaches, but this works for me.

== Installation

A `jpackage`-generated image is available under Releases.
`jpackage` bundles the required JRE with the executable, so nothing else is required to run An Image Viewer.

For other distributions or running from source, see <<Building>> below.

== Building

The application is written in Kotlin using JavaFX, and built by Gradle.

If you are familiar with Gradle, you can just clone this repository and execute `run` to execute it.
Note that An Image Viewer closes immediately if there is no argument, so if you execute `run` you probably want to add `--args "..."` as well.

== License

zlib License, see `LICENSE` file.
